Sending postcards to registered voters has long been a common tactic in U.S. political campaigns. In this analysis, we use data from a 2006 field experiment in Michigan to help guide strategies for boosting turnout in the current Texas gubernatorial election, while acknowledging that Michigan may differ from both Texas and the national context.One potential weakness of our model is that the effect of postcards on voter turnout in Michigan in 2006 may not be stable over time or representative of voter behavior in Texas today.

$$P(Y = 1) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \cdots + \beta_n X_n)}}$$

with $Y \sim \text{Bernoulli}(\rho)$ where $\rho$ is the probability above.
